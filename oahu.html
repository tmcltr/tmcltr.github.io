<h2>Food and Drink</h2>

<h3>Best tiki bar</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lamarianasailingclub.com">La Mariana Sailing Club</a> is sort of hard to find, tucked away in an industrial area, but it's worth it for sheer tiki joy. Try to go around sunset.</p>

<pre><code>La Mariana Sailing Club
50 Sand Island Access Rd
Honolulu, HI 96819
(808) 848-2800
</code></pre>

<h3>Best place to get a mai-tai</h3>

<p>It's actually pretty rare to find a good mai-tai in Hawaii. Even <strong>La Mariana</strong> screws it up, though not as badly as most of the hotel bars in Waikiki, adding all kinds of extraneous fruit juices and sugary syrups and flavors that aren't supposed to be there. For the best mai tai in Waikiki, go to the beachfront bar in the Haleakulani Hotel, named after a Charlie Chan novel.</p>

</code></pre>

<h3>Saimin (like ramen)</h3>

<p>Saimin is the Hawaiian take on Japanese ramen. You can even get it at McDonalds. <strong>Shiro's Saimin Haven</strong> is my favorite. The place is quirky, decorated the Confucious-like sayings of Shiro himself, and they have a comically long menu.</p>

<pre><code>Shiro’s Saimin Haven
Waimalo Shopping Center
98-020 Kamehameha Highway
Aiea, HI 96701
</code></pre>

<p>For a more Japanese-style ramen, <a href="http://gomatei.com/">Goma Tei</a> near <strong>Ala Moana Center</strong> is supposed to be really good.</p>

<h3>Plate lunch</h3>

<p>Plate lunch is Hawaiian soul food. You get a meat (or two), a scoop of sticky rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad.</p>

<p>When they say <em>barbecue</em> they generally mean <em>teriyaki</em>.</p>

<h3>Shave ice in Honolulu</h3>

<pre><code>Waiola Shave Ice
2135 Waiola Ave
Honolulu, HI 96805
</code></pre>

<h3>Shave Ice in Haleiwa (on the north shore)</h3>

<pre><code>Aoki’s Shave Ice
66 Kamehameha Hwy
Haleiwa, HI 96712
</code></pre>

<p>Haleiwa, on the north shore, has two famous shave-ice places: Aoki's and Matsumoto's. I've only been to Aoki's, because the line at Matsumoto's is usually too long, and because my Aunt likes Aoki's better for some reason. Highly recommended, though!</p>

<p>There's a Matsumoto's near Honolulu, too.</p>

<h3>BAKED GOODS</h3>

<p>Malasadas are a Portuguese-Catholic invention designed to rid your house of butter and sugar in preparation for Lent. They're Hawaii's donut. Sort of like donuts, but a little fluffier, and they don't have a hole. They come in two varieties: filled and un-filled. Get some of each. Eat them hot, they're <em>incredibly good</em>, but they’re not as good the next day. We usually end up getting them at night, for some reason.</p>

<pre><code>Leonard’s Bakery
933 Kapahulu Avenue
Honolulu, HI 96816
</code></pre>

<p>There's a smaller location in Waimalu Shopping Center. (Which has other great food options, too.)</p>

<pre><code>Leonard Jr.’s
Waimalu Shopping Center
98-042 Kamehameha Hwy # 3
Aiea, HI 96701
</code></pre>

<p>Branching out from malasadas, other island favorites include haupia pie (chocolate and coconut) and coco puffs (cream puffs with a chocolate filling). Get them at <strong>Liliha Bakery</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Liliha Bakery
515 N. Kuakini Street
</code></pre>

<h3>MANAPUA</h3>

<p>Manapua is what Hawaiians call <em>bao</em>: steamed white rice flour buns with a char siu pork filling. This is the taste of my childhood visits to Hawaii. You can get them almost anywhere, it's like grabbing a sandwich.</p>

<p>The best I've had were from <a href="http://charhungsut.com/">Char Hung Sut</a>, but the process can be a little intense. It's not a restaurant, just a kitchen. When you get to the front of the line, a very efficient older lady will ask you how many you want. Then she'll wrap them up for you, and send you on your way. They typically sell out and close early, so go before noon. Closed Tuesday. Cash only.</p>

<pre><code>Char Hung Sut
64 N Pauahi St
Honolulu, HI 96817
(808) 538-3335
</code></pre>

<p>Another great option (and maybe more convenient) is <a href="http://www.libbymanapuashop.com/">Libby Manapua Shop</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Libby Manapua Shop
410 Kalihi St
Honolulu, HI 96819
(808) 841-2253
</code></pre>

<h3>SHRIMP TRUCK</h3>

<p>Between Laie and Haleiwa you’ll see three or four shrimp trucks. They’re all selling roughly the same thing, but we’ve always liked Romy’s because they get their shrimp from a pond/bog/farm literally twenty feet away from the truck.</p>

<pre><code>Romy’s Kahuku Prawns &amp; Shrimp Hut
56-781 Kamehameha Hwy
Kahuku, HI 96731-2301
</code></pre>

<p>The Like-Like Drive-In downtown is my dad's all-time favorite restaurant going back to his high-school days, serving Hawaiian favorites like Loco Moco and chiffon pie. It's got a distinct mid-century coffee shop feel, but less kitschy and more institutional. Kelsey hates it.</p>

<h2>Hiking</h2>

<p>(to be expanded)</p>

<p>The forests/jungle around Manoa is really nice for hiking. It’s beautiful, close to Honolulu, and it’s usually about 15 degrees cooler than Waikiki. There’s the Judd Trail, which is sort of a loop, but there’s some cool little swimming holes you can check out. Look up the Manoa Falls trail. It’s super easy, like a mile and a half, and it’s gorgeous, with a huge waterfall at the end. It’s also near the old Paradise Park, which was a sort of bird-zoo tourist attraction that closed in the early 90s and has been rotting ever since. Kind of eery, but interesting and beautiful. Lots of LOST has been filmed around there.</p>

<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

<ul>
<li>You need sunglasses, and a hat. Wear sunscreen, but remember it's not a free pass to hang out in the sun as long as you want. You're from Oregon. Find shade often.</li>
<li>Costco is the only place to buy groceries and not feel like you're being robbed. Though you probably will be robbed if you leave anything of value visible in your rental car while you're in there.</li>
<li>Don’t worry that there’s a better beach somewhere else.
You like where you are? Stay there. Relax.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tourism</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Waikiki</strong> is extremely crowded. Don't expect anything to happen quickly, efficiently, or privately.</li>
<li>Skip <strong>Hanauma Bay</strong>. It’s a tourist trap, and there are better places to snorkel. Like Shark’s Cove on the north shore. (No sharks.)</li>
<li>The <strong>Polynesian Cultural Center</strong> is totally touristy and probably a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mormon Church, but my parents really enjoyed it.</li>
<li>If you're into history, go to the <strong>Bishop Museum</strong> in Honolulu and see old Hawaiian things.</li>
<li>The tours at <strong>Pearl Harbor</strong> are actually pretty neat if you're into military history and/or America™. They take a while, though. You'll probably spend at least half a day here.</li>
<li>There's a <a href="http://www.alohastadiumswapmeet.net/">swap meet at the stadium in Aiea</a> every Wednesday. This is the place to buy your souvenirs, if you're the kind of person who buys souvenirs.</li>
</ul>


<h4>LOST Nerdery:</h4>

<p>There's a beach on the north shore, off <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@21.6128709,-158.09432,17z">Papailoa Rd</a> that was used in a lot of <strong>LOST</strong> filming. Coincidentally, it's a great place to see sea turtles.</p>

<p>The Dharma Village (from <em>LOST</em>) is at a YMCA camp near <strong>Dillingham Air Field</strong> on the north shore. The <strong>Judd Trail</strong> in Manoa Valley is where they did a lot of the jungle-y scenes. Also near Manoa there's also an old bird-related tourist trap called <strong>Paradise Park</strong> that closed in 1994 and has been rusting and overgrown ever since. It's kind of awesome now. Remember when Sawyer and Kate were trapped in cages? That was at Paradise Park.</p>

<h4>Hawaiian Words</h4>

<p>Pronouncing words is easier than it looks. Vowels sound pretty much like they do in Spanish. Every vowel gets a syllable, unless they're right next to each other, then you slur them together. Or if there's a mark between two vowels, you pronounce each of them separately.</p>

<p>As every guidebook and tour guide will tell you, <strong>makai</strong> is a directional term that means <em>toward the sea</em>, and <strong>mauka</strong> means <em>toward the mountains</em>. Guidebooks and tour guides go out of their way to use these words, but practically no one else uses them, ever. Unless it's a business catering to tourists.</p>
